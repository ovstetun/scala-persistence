# Scala Persistence

This project is to show different ways to interact with a relational database in Scala.

* Raw JDBC
* JPA (using [Eclipselink][eclipselink])
* [ScalaQuery][scalaquery]
* [Squeryl][squeryl]


## Running the project

The project contains specifications written in [specs2], and built with [sbt 0.10.x][sbt]. The specs require a file database generated by [Liquibase][liquibase] to work. This is to make sure all the strategies work against the same database. To run the tests:

    xsbt update
    xsbt copy-resources
    ./db.sh
    xsbt test
    
If by some weird error the database becomes corrupt, just delete all the `test.*.db` files: `rm test.*.db`.
